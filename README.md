# Build a Full Stack App with Rust, Yew.rs and Actix Web

In this article, I'll walk you through the process of building a backend API using the Actix web framework, SQLX, PostgreSQL, and Docker. Once we've created a powerful backend, we'll move on to building a single-page app using the Yew.rs framework. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional web app that seamlessly integrates the frontend app with the backend API.
