## What is Rust?

Rust has been Stack Overflow's most loved language for four years in a row and rightfully so. Rust is a blazing fast and memory-efficient static compiled language with a rich type system and ownership model. It can be used to power performance-critical services while guaranteeing memory-safety and thread-safety, empowering developers to debug at compile-time.
